    </div>

    <div class="modal-body bg-white">
        <p>The SAP User Experience Community Privacy Statement (this “Privacy Statement”) covers the use of this website, www.experience.sap.com and any subpages which reference this Privacy Statement (the “Experience Community Website”). Some SAP entities, programs and/or sites may have their own, possibly different, privacy statements. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each of the SAP websites or program information you visit or review.</p>

        <h3>Consent</h3>

        <p>By using this Website, you consent to the collection and use of the information as described here. If we decide to make changes to this Privacy Statement, we will post the changes on this site so that you will always know what information we collect, and how we use it.</p>

        <p>From time to time, as may be required by applicable law, we may also seek your explicit consent to process certain data and information collected on this website or volunteered by you.</p>

        <h3>Collection and Processing of Your Personal Data</h3>

        <p>To serve you better and understand your needs and interests, SAP collects, exports, and uses personal information that you provide when you sign up for an account.</p>

        <p>We may further collect and process any information and data that you volunteer to us, e.g. when you register for events, subscribe to newsletters or participate in online surveys, discussion groups or forums.</p>

        <h3>Use and Purpose of Collected Personal Data</h3>

        <p>The information SAP collects to understand your needs and interests helps SAP deliver a consistent and personalized experience. We will use such information only as described in this Privacy Statement and/or in the way we specify at the time of collection. Some of the ways we may use your personal data include, but are not limited to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>To provide services that you have requested;</li>

            <li>To keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, software upgrades, security patches, system enhancements, special offers, and other information. This may occasionally include information from other technology companies or business partners about products and services that can add value to your SAP products;
            </li>

            <li>To tailor information about our products and services to your individual interests. For example, during a visit to our site, it allows us to provide you with specific information on products and services that may be of interest;
            </li>

            <li>To provide the ability to create personal profile areas and view protected content;</li>


            <li>To provide the ability to contact you and to provide customer feedback and support;

            </li>

            <li>To provide contests, sweepstakes or other marketing or promotional activities on the Experience Community Website. Personal data may be collected to administer those programs; <br/>
                <br/>
                To meet contractual obligations; and/or<br/><br/>

            <li>To conduct voluntary questionnaires and surveys in order to provide better products and services to our customers and end users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Email Addresses; Choice/Opt-Out</h3>

        <p>We communicate with users who subscribe to our services on a regular basis via email, and we may also communicate by phone to resolve customer complaints or investigate suspicious transactions. We may use your email address to confirm your opening of an account, to send you information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.</p>

        <p>SAP provides you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive other types of communication from us such as emails or updates from us regarding new services and products offered on this website or if you do not want us to share your personal information with third parties.</p>

        <p>We do not share your e-mail address with others outside the SAP group of companies, which includes SAP AG and its affiliates (“SAP Group”), as necessary to provide services you request. Depending on how your e-mail application is set up, information about you may be transmitted automatically when you send e-mail to SAP.</p>

        <h3>Sharing Your Personal Data</h3>

        <p>By providing SAP with any personal data under this Privacy Statement, you consent, agree and confirm that your personal data will be processed in the United States of America.</p>

        <p>Companies in the SAP Group may use the information internationally in connection with processing your inquiries and orders, to help improve our products and services and for processing and storage.</p>

        <p>We may also share such information with business partners, service vendors, authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide a requested service or transaction, including hosting websites, hosting event and seminar registration and providing customer support, or providing you with information on products and services that may be of interest to you.

        <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes unless you have granted us permission to do so.</p>

        <p>We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your personal data and other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>

        <p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, SAP decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve, in accordance with applicable law, the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is SAP's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p>

        <p>We may collect and possibly share personal data and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of SAP's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>

        <p>While visiting SAP's website you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third-party supplier. When information is collected on behalf of SAP exclusively, the appropriate SAP entity's privacy statement will be referenced on the site and will govern how information is used. Other, non-SAP sites, may have their own privacy statements and personal data collection, use, and disclosure practices. We strongly advise you to familiarize yourself with the privacy statements provided by these other non-SAP sites prior to providing them with any information.</p>

        <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>

        <p>This site may contain links to other sites. SAP is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites outside the SAP Group of companies.</p>

        <h3>Inquiries, Access and Updating Your Personal Data; Deletion of Account</h3>

        <p>SAP needs your help in keeping the personal data you have shared with us accurate and up to date. If you are a registered user, you may make these updates yourself in your profile.</p>

        <p>If you have any other questions about this privacy statement or if you wish to (1) inspect or delete the information we hold about you or (2) make a complaint about misuse of your personal data by another user, please contact:</p>
